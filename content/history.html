    <h1>Santiago, history and legends</h1>
    <p>Many stories and legends are told about Santiago, here are some of them.</p>
    <p><em>Made by Eduardo Baston at 13/10/2022<br>Fragments extracted from "ViveCamino" and "All about Spain"</em>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Work begins on the Romanesque cathedral</h2>
    <p>Santiago took its first steps to becoming the <strong>spiritual lighthouse of Europe</strong>, a title that would bring numerous
        riches to the city. Knowing this, the Muslim leader of Andalusia, Almanzor, devastated the city in the year 997,
        although he did respect the tomb of the Apostle. Legend recalls that it was the Christian prisoners who, after
        the raid, <strong>carried the temple bells from Compostela to Cordoba</strong> .</p>
    <p>After this event and, following the reconstruction of the centre and, of the temple itself, an <strong>urban expansion of
        Santiago</strong> took place. Fortified walls were constructed to defend the expanding historical city and ground
        preparations were made so that, in 1075, building work could commence for a larger temple, more appropriate for
        the popularity of this pilgrimage. </p>

    <h2>Pilgrim's shell</h2>
    <p>There are many legends that explain the origin of the Camino de Santiago and the symbols that are associated with
        it. One of them is <strong>the legend of the Pilgrim’s Shell:</strong> the famous <em>"Vieira de Santiago"</em>.
    </p>
    <p>This pilgrim legend was developed around the Vigo Estuary, in front of the Cies Islands. When the remains of
        Santiago the Apostle, on his way to Galicia, passed by the disciples who accompanied the saint saw that
        <strong>on the shore that a wedding was being celebrated.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>In the celebration, the guests, mounted on horseback, threw a stick in the air and played to pick it up before it
        hit the ground. On one of the occasions the groom threw the spear into the air, it went to the sea. The young
        man, trying to reach her, ended up <strong>losing the horse and sinking into the water.</strong></p>
    <p>Suddenly, both the groom and the horse re-appeared along with the small boat that carried the body of the
        apostle. The amazing thing about this legend is that when they reappeared, <strong>the groom’s body was
            completely covered with scallop shells.</strong></p>
