    <h1>Toponomy of Santiago</h1>
    <p>In this case, the toponomy of the city name can be easly guessed, here's the story behind it:</p>
    <p><em>Made by Eduardo Baston at 13/10/2022<br>Fragments extracted from "SantiagoWays" and "La Informacion"</em>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Apostle James</h2>
    <p>The name Santiago goes back to the <strong>Apostle James</strong> (Saint James = Santiago) who went to this most
        north-western part of Spain, called by the Romans "<em>Finis Terrae</em>", "end of the world", to preach and
        convert people to Christianity.</p>
    <p>
        After returning to Palestine in 44 a.C., he was taken prisoner by <strong>Herodes Agrippa</strong> and tortured
        to death. The king forbid to bury him, but in the night Jacob's disciples stole the body and brought him, in a
        sarcophagus of marble, on board of a small boat. The current of the sea drove the boat to the Spanish coast,
        into the port of the Roman province's capital, Iria Flavia. Here the Apostle was buried at a secret place in a
        wood.<br>
        Centuries later, in 813, the <strong>hermit Pelayo</strong> listened music in that wood and saw a shining. For
        this shining the place was called, in Latin, "<em>Campus Stellae</em>", field of the star, name that was later
        on turned into Compostela.
