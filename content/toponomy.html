            <h2>Apostle James</h2>
            <p>The name Santiago goes back to the <strong>Apostle James</strong> (Saint James = Santiago) who went to this most
                north-western part of Spain, called by the Romans "<em>Finis Terrae</em>", "end of the world", to preach and
                convert people to Christianity.</p>
            <p>
                After returning to Palestine in 44 a.C., he was taken prisoner by <strong>Herodes Agrippa</strong> and tortured
                to death. The king forbid to bury him, but in the night Jacob's disciples stole the body and brought him, in a
                sarcophagus of marble, on board of a small boat. The current of the sea drove the boat to the Spanish coast,
                into the port of the Roman province's capital, Iria Flavia. Here the Apostle was buried at a secret place in a
                wood.<br>
                Centuries later, in 813, the <strong>hermit Pelayo</strong> listened music in that wood and saw a shining. For
                this shining the place was called, in Latin, "<em>Campus Stellae</em>", field of the star, name that was later
                on turned into Compostela.
