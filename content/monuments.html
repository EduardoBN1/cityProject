    <h1>Main monuments of Santiago</h1>
    <p>Santiago de Compostela contains several well-known monuments, here we will be mentioning a few of them.</p>
    <p><em>Made by Eduardo Baston at 13/10/2022<br>Fragments extracted from "Wikipedia" and "Culture Trip"</em></p>
    <br>
    <h2>Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela</h2>
    <p>This one is perhaps the most known monument among all of them, also known as the <em>"Archcathedral Basilica of
        Santiago"</em>, it's main function is being the reputed burial place of <strong>Saint James the
        Great</strong> this means it's also among the remaining churches in the world built over the tomb of an
        apostle, forming a total of 5.</p>
    <p>This structure has been a place of pilgrimage since the early middle ages and marks the traditional end of the
        pilgrimage route. The building is a Romanesque structure, with later <strong>Gothic and Baroque
        additions</strong>. It counts with several elements such as the Portico of Glory, the tympanum, the mullion,
        jambs, towers and many façades. </p>

    <h2>Monastery of San Martiño Pinario</h2>
    <p>The monastery of San Martiño Pinario was a Benedictine monastery in the city of Santiago. It's the <strong>second
        largest monastery in Spain</strong> after "San Lorenzo de El Escorial". Little remains of the original
        medieval buildings, as the monastery has been largely rebuilt since the sixteenth century.</p>
    <p>It originated in a chapel dedicated to Santa Maria called <em>"the Corticela"</em> which was demolished in the
        late ninth century, except the chapel, which today is part of the Cathedral of Santiago, when <strong>King
        Afonso III the Great</strong> and the bishop Sisnando began the new cathedral construction. Around the year
        899, this monastery was built where Benedictine monks moved from the old chapel. This monastery was later
        replaced by another whose church was consecrated in 1102. </p>
    <h2>Hostal dos Reis Católicos</h2>
    <p>This building sits on the same square as the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, and was commissioned by the
        <strong>Catholic Monarchs</strong> in 1501 as a hospital for sick pilgrims who walked the <em>Camino de
        Santiago</em>.
    </p>
    <p>The main building was designed by royal architect <strong>Enrique Egás</strong>, while the intricate façade, with
        carved figurines, was designed by French architects <strong>Martín de Blas and Gullén de Colás</strong>. Today
        the building is the luxurious five-star Hotel Parador, complete with period furniture and four-poster beds.</p>
