            <h2>Rosalia de Castro</h2>
            <p>Rosalía de Castro was a Galician writer who promoted and valued literature in this language. Considered a
                <strong>fundamental author of the 19th century</strong>, she died young, a victim of uterine cancer. Throughout
                various trips and
                changes of address, she wrote several works of great quality, both poetic and narrative. The best known of hers,
                hers <em>'Follas Novas'</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rosalía de Castro was born in the city of Santiago de Compostela on <strong>February 24, 1837</strong>. The
                daughter of anoblewoman and a priest, she was considered a poor birth, so at first <strong>she was not accepted
                    by her mother's family</strong>. Therefore, during her early years, she was raised by her two paternal
                aunts.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the age of five, she moved with her mother to the town of <em>Padrón</em> (La Coruña). Her adolescence was
                marked by a
                <strong>deep life crisis</strong> after the discovery of her illegitimate daughter status and by a delicate
                health that she never
                improved.
